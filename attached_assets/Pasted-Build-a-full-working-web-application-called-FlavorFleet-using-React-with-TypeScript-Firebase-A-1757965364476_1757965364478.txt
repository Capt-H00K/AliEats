Build a full working web application called "FlavorFleet" using React (with TypeScript), Firebase (Auth + Firestore), and Tailwind CSS. This app is a delivery platform for a single restaurant with multiple drivers and multiple customers. Include the following requirements:

1. **Frontend:**
   - Use React 18 with TypeScript.
   - Use functional components and hooks.
   - Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Pages:
     - Customer Dashboard: browse menu, place orders.
     - Driver Dashboard: view assigned orders, confirm cash/bank payment received.
     - Restaurant Dashboard: view all orders, update order status.
   - Components:
     - MenuCard, OrderCard, DriverCard, Navbar, MobileNav.
     - Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Modal, Toast, etc.).
   - Authentication: signup/login for customers and drivers using Firebase Auth.

2. **Backend (Firebase Firestore):**
   - Collections:
     - users (customers and drivers)
     - orders (with fields: customerId, driverId, items, totalPrice, status, paymentMethod, paymentConfirmed)
     - menu (items with name, description, price)
   - Users can be either 'customer' or 'driver'.
   - Drivers can mark payments as received.

3. **Orders & Payments:**
   - Customers can select items and choose payment method: "Cash on Delivery" or "Bank Transfer".
   - Drivers can confirm receipt of payment in the app.
   - Restaurant sees all orders but is not involved in payments.

4. **Firebase Integration:**
   - Initialize Firebase with the following credentials:
     ```
     apiKey: "AIzaSyD7NedynjEGpfMevRcG81n2gv1tLvT1g-k"
     authDomain: "flavorfleet-a9b09.firebaseapp.com"
     projectId: "flavorfleet-a9b09"
     storageBucket: "flavorfleet-a9b09.firebasestorage.app"
     messagingSenderId: "38387869918"
     appId: "1:38387869918:web:12f100d594eb8120673a4f"
     measurementId: "G-ERNMEW6E0J"
     ```
   - Use modular Firebase SDK imports (v10+).
   - Export `auth` and `db` for use across the app.

5. **Project Structure:**
